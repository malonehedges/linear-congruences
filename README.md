# linear-congruences

> Solve linear congruences online!

I realize this project has a high boilerplate to code ratio.
**The interesting part of this project is located in `src/App.vue`.** I used vue-cli with the `webpack` template to save time setting everything up. I may simplify the structure of the project in the future, but have no immediate plans to do so.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at `localhost:8080`
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
